Abstract Land Statement       In my work, I wanted to change up the original view of landscape, and produced brand new images in an abstract way. For me, abstract land means you can no longer tell what the land is suppose to look like anymore. I started out with shooting new photos for this series, but I wasn’t in love with them at all. However, I still managed to use a few of them in the bottom left image. I used two blurred photos and two clear photos of the same location to create the final look in Photoshop. The top left was created in the same manner but with 4 photos of sun rising at different time of a day. Lastly I used an old photo I took of Golden Gate Bridge and a broken mirror to invent a non-typical view of the bridge.
